# gulp-ng-recipes

A collection of gulp tasks to share with all your projects.

When gulp 4 is released, gulp-ng-recipes will be rewritten to support [custom registries](https://github.com/phated/undertaker#custom-registries).


This module comes with `gulp-sass`. if you prefer `gulp-ruby-sass` then install:

```bash
npm install gulp-ruby-sass --save-dev 
```
and add `import 'gulp-ng-recipes/dist/sass.js';` to your `gulpfile.babel.js`
